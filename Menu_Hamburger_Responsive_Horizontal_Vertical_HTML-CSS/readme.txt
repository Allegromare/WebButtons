This sleek horizontal menu bar stays tucked away until the user clicks on an icon, revealing the menu. 
Using CSS3, various parts of the menu are animated, from the menu unveil to the icon flip when clicked on. 
Pizzazz aside, at its core this is a menu that's highly responsive to various devices and screen sizes. The
 menu intelligently switches between the standard menu bar, a slightly truncated menu, to a drop down menu 
 based on the user's available screen real estate. It's a beautiful thing when style and function come together!

By default two break points are defined- one when the user's viewable screen size is 580px or less, and the other, 560px. 
Depending on your menu's width and at what screen width the menu starts to get truncated, you'll want to edit the above 
two values accordingly.
